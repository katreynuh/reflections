What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

  Initializing a repository starts the tracking of files including changes in
  the contents of the directory where the repository was initialized. This is
  essential if I want to use Git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

  The working directory is the local area as to where my files are located whereas
  a repository is the cloud as to where I want to save my files from the working
  directory. The staging area serves as the bridge between the two. It is where
  we prepare our files to be committed to the repository.
